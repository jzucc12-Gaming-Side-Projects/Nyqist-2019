This is the first project I independently worked on in Game Maker Studio 2. I was active in this project over the course of 2018 and 2019, only stopping
because graduate school work picked up. The point of the project was for me to try out creating different sytems such as movement, combat, 
dialogue, and settings. I wanted to mess around with as many different things here as possible to get a feel for how each works. 
I eventually started over in 2020 when Game Maker had a big update come out. I wrote the majority of the code with certain scripts coming 
from tutorials I was following. Art assets were aquired from online.

This game was aimed to be a fantasy/cyber-punk JRPG with two playable characters. The twist to the combat system was that each player could equip up to two items, 
one in each hand. Each hand would get both a timer and turn in combat, meaning that the two characters would get a total of four turns. The art and music assets 
implemented were obtained from online resources.
