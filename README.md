This is the first project I independently started in GMS2 and was worked on over the course of 2018 and 2019. The point of the project
was for me to try out creating different sytems such as movement, combat, dialogue, and settings. I wanted to mess around with
as many different things here as possible to get a feel for how each works. During 2019, graduate school work picked up and I had to 
stop the project. I eventually started over in 2020 when Game Maker had a big update come out. I wrote the majority of the code with
certain scripts coming from tutorials I was following. Art assets were aquired from online.

This game was aimed to be a fantasy/cyber-punk JRPG with two playable characters. The twist to the combat was a system was that each
player could equip up to two items, one in each hand. Each hand would get a timer and turn in combat, meaning that the two characters
would get a total of four turns. The art and music assets implemented were stand-in as I was trying to figure out the basics of creating
a game at the time.
